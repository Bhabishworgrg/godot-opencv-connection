# Godot OpenCV Connection

A showcase of how Godot can be connected with OpenCV (along with mediapipe) to control game behaviour through real-time hand gesture recognition.

---

## How It Works
- #### Python Side (Finger Detection):
Uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect a hand from webcam input and count the number of raised fingers.
- #### Godot Side (Canvas Update):
Listens for the finger count and changes the canvas colour based on the received number.
> The applications communicate through a TCP connection.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Godot 4.x
